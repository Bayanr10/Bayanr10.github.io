            <h3>Black Phone 2</h3>

            <p>Finally saw Black Phone 2 like an hour ago.</p>
            <p>Originally the plan was to watch the first movie in preparation for the second then go watch that one when it came out, but after seeing the first movie it kind of got put on the back burner.
                 Really wasn't a fan of the first one if I'm being honest, it just felt too cheesy. But the movies about to get out of theaters so it was time to rip the band-aid off.
            </p>
            <p>Anyways, the movie rocked. Actually jumpscare city. They got me so bad it was humiliating, there were multiple points I was just tensed up waiting for the jumpscare to come and get me.</p>
            <p>Easy 4 star movie, enjoyed it a lot. Girlfriend said there were a bunch of homages but idk man it was pretty scary and thats good enough for me.</p>

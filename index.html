                <h3>Minbo, or the Gentle Art of Japanese Extortion</h3>
                    <p>What a blast, this movie was a lot of fun and didn't take itself to seriously. I can see why they killed the director though, talk about ragebait</p>

                <img src="assets\images\taxidriver.jpg" alt="taxidriver.jpg" width = 100px height= 150px>
                    <p>Originally I was put off by the films age, being published in 1976 and all. But nonetheless decided to give it a chance.</p>
                    <p>The movie as a whole gives off a melancholic vibe, even during the more intense scenes. The city B-roll when he was just driving around was also incredible, especially when paired with the soft jazz music. The city atmosphere was captured so well and incorporated so flawlessly into the movie. The dialogue between characters and the backdrops (like the diner) add so much character and make it seem more "real" if that makes sense.</p> 
                    <p>Overall an incredible film, definitely worth the hype.</p>

                <img src="assets\images\wildrobot.jpg" alt="wildrobot.jpg" width = 100px height= 150px>
                <p>Human creativity is so beautiful.</p>
                <p>There is something about childrens movies that are so plain and pure I can't not enjoy them. I watched this movie and had a blast from start to finish.</p>

                <img src="assets\images\midnightrun.jpg" alt="midnightrun.jpg" width = 100px height= 150px>
                <p>To me this is one of those movies you watch with your family on some type of vacation from school. The feel and ambiance of the movie is so
                nostalgic in a way to the early 2000's movies I would watch at my grandmas house on her CRT tv</p>
                <p>I feel like this movie just does it right. Like the perfect depiction of an average box-office movie from the time.</p>
